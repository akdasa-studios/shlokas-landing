        Service.<br>Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the

        purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.</p>
    <p>Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through Shlokas and confirm

    <h2 id="mode-and-place-of-processing-the-data">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
    <h3 id="methods-of-processing">Methods of processing</h3>
    <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
        unauthorized destruction of the Data. </p>
    <p>The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures
        and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
        accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of Shlokas (administration, sales,
        marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers,
        mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
        Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
    <h3 id="legal-basis-of-processing">Legal basis of processing</h3>
    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner
            may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without
            having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever
            the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
            pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
            authority vested in the Owner;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
            party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
        in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
        necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
    <h3 id="place">Place</h3>
    <p>The Data is processed at the Owner&#39;s operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in
        the processing are located. </p>
    <p>Depending on the User&#39;s location, data transfers may involve transferring the User&#39;s Data to a country
        other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check
        the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
    <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union
        or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries,
        such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data. </p>
    <p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
        inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
    <h3 id="retention-time">Retention time</h3>
    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User
            shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
        <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as
            needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests
            pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such
        processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal
        Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of
        an authority. </p>
    <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access, the right to
        erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
        retention period.</p>
    <h2 id="the-purposes-of-processing">The purposes of processing</h2>
    <p>The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its legal
        obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of its Users or third
        parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following: Registration and
        authentication, Infrastructure monitoring and Platform services and hosting.</p>
    <p>For specific information about the Personal Data used for each purpose, the User may refer to the section

    <p>This type of service allows Shlokas to monitor the use and behavior of its components so its performance,
        operation, maintenance and troubleshooting can be improved.<br>Which Personal Data are processed depends on the
        characteristics and mode of implementation of these services, whose function is to filter the activities of
        Shlokas. </p>
    <h4 id="sentry-functional-software-inc-">Sentry (Functional Software, Inc.)</h4>

    <h3 id="registration-and-authentication">Registration and authentication</h3>
    <p>By registering or authenticating, Users allow Shlokas to identify them and give them access to dedicated

    <p>Sign in with Apple is a registration and authentication service provided by Apple Inc. In cases where Users are
        required to provide their email address, Sign in with Apple may generate a private relay address on behalf of

    <p>These services have the purpose of hosting and running key components of Shlokas, therefore allowing the
        provision of Shlokas from within a unified platform. Such platforms provide a wide range of tools to the Owner –
        e.g. analytics, user registration, commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment processing – that imply
        the collection and handling of Personal Data.<br>Some of these services work through geographically distributed
        servers, making it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal Data are stored.</p>

    <p>Shlokas is distributed on the Google Play Store, a platform for the distribution of mobile apps, provided by
        Google LLC. By virtue of being distributed via this app store, Google collects usage and diagnostics data and
        share aggregate information with the Owner. Much of this information is processed on an opt-in basis. Users may
        opt-out of this analytics feature directly through their device settings. More information on how to manage
